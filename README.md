A common and lethal kind of cancer, breast
cancer, affects women worldwide. In the year 2020, around
2.26 million breast cancer cases were reported worldwide. In
2020, breast cancer will become the most common cancer
globally with a projected 11.7% of all cancer cases or 2.3
million new cases. It is ranked as 7th cancer cause globally
with 685,000 deaths. Diagnosis plays an essential role in
cancer, since early diagnosis of the condition can help in
better planning for treatment and prevent further
complications. Our work is to develop an integrated system
to aid oncologists and clinicians in the diagnosis,
confirmation and follow-up analysis for breast cancer using
principles of artificial intelligence and medical imaging
modalities. The decision making is made by deep learning
models trained on thousands of images of several medical
imaging modalities. On the whole, the proposed system can
help the clinicians in their medical decisions and provide
better service for patients with breast cancer.
